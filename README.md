## Setup
To install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
Download: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1heVF8flYGfrxEnBqNvjYcgTzpSBke6IV?usp=share_link

Put data folder under the *outputs* directory. e.g., ZETT/outputs/data/fewrel/unseen_10_seed_0/train.jsonl


## Train
For each dataset, we have 30 different setups for 5/10/15 unseen relations and 5 different data folds. To train with a specific setting:

e.g. on FewRel dataset with the setting of 10 unseen relations and data fold #0:
```
python run_zett.py train --data_name ['fewrel'] --n_unseen_rel [10] --rd_fold [0] --model_name {model_name}
```

e.g. on wiki-ZSL dataset with the setting of 15 unseen relations and data fold #1, 2, 3:
```
python run_zett.py train --data_name ['wiki'] --n_unseen_rel [15] --rd_fold [1, 2, 3] --model_name {model_name}
```

To train for all settings at once:  
```
python run_zett.py train --model_name {model_name}
```


## Evaluate triplet extraction

### Test on the single-triplet test set

To test with a specific setting:

e.g. on FewRel dataset with the setting of 10 unseen relations and data fold #0:
```
python run_zett.py test --data_name ['fewrel'] --n_unseen_rel [10] --rd_fold [0] --model_name {model_name}
```

Test all setting: 
```
python run_zett.py test --model_name {model_name}
```

### Test on the multi-triplet test set
Set **eval_mode** option to *multi*
```
python run_zett.py test --model_name {model_name} --eval_mode 'multi'
```

### Inference *without* relation constraint
Set **use_label_constraint** option to *False*
```
python run_zett.py test --model_name {model_name} --use_label_constraint False
```



### Evaluate relation extraction (or relation classification)

Use **task_type** option to set the target task.

```
python run_zett.py test --model_name {model_name} --task_type RC
```

### Choice of templates

Train/test with the paraphrased templates from the back-translation (English-German) machine translation model.
```
python run_zett.py train --model_name {model_name} --templ_file templates/templates_paraphrased_top1.tsv

python run_zett.py test --model_name {model_name} --templ_file templates/templates_paraphrased_top1.tsv
```
